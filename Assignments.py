What We Want To Do:
Asteroid Fleet Completion

Big Questions:
Should we downsize all objects or try to make a scrolling screen, levels == Game purpose??  #done
Is a multiplayer option worth doing?   #Yes I think this would be pretty sweet. Although it would take some effort. - Tucker

Things To Add:

Enemies / Shoot Function for them 
Slow Down Time Power Up
New Art For HyperSpeed Icon - jj 
Buttons to the Start Screen 
Sounds for all Powerups, collisions, new modes, death... - Tucker
Shield Bar? -- Might not be neccesary
Mega Asteroids ? Asteroid storm ? Space junk? - jj
Nuke Powerup, Maybe Easter Egg... Found / used once per game, clears all asteroids from screen, maybe all images change slightly 
Star wars description intro, command log, giving background to game 

Things that Need to be Fixed / Tweaked:
