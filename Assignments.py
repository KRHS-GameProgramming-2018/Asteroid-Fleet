What We Want To Do:
Asteroid Fleet Completion

Big Questions:
Should we downsize all objects or try to make a scrolling screen, levels == Game purpose??
Is a multiplayer option worth doing? 

Things To Add:

Enemies / Shoot Function for them 
Slow Down Time Power Up
New Art For HyperSpeed Icon 
Buttons to the Start Screen 
Sounds for all Powerups, collisions, new modes, death... 
Shield Bar? -- Might not be neccesary
Mega Asteroids ? Asteroid storm ? Space junk?
Nuke Powerup, Maybe Easter Egg... Found / used once per game, clears all asteroids from screen, maybe all images change slightly 
Star wars description intro, command log, giving background to game 

Things that Need to be Fixed / Tweaked:

One of the asteroids has weird imaging on the edges 
Explosion images should be resized in pic art because coding sizing makes it pixelated
Missiles spawn slightly off center from player (below and to the right) should be fixed 
Startsceen still has old repair kit icon on it
